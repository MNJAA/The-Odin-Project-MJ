            <h3>Cooking steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Butterfly the Fish:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Clean the fresh carp by removing scales, gills, and internal organs.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Rinse the fish thoroughly under cold water.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Butterfly the fish by slicing it along the belly and flattening it out, skin-side down.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    Marinate the Fish:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            In a bowl, mix olive oil, tamarind paste, lemon juice, minced garlic, turmeric, cumin,
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            paprika, salt, and black pepper to create the marinade.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Rub the marinade generously over the entire fish, ensuring it's well-coated.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Let the fish marinate for at least 1 hour to absorb the flavors.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                <li>
                    Prepare the Grill:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Set up an open flame or wood fire grill. Ensure the grill grates are clean and lightly oiled
                            to prevent sticking.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If using a traditional method, arrange the fish on special skewers designed for Maskoof or
                            directly on the grill grates.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    Grill the Fish:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Place the fish skin-side down on the grill.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Grill over medium heat for about 30-45 minutes, depending on the size of the fish, until the
                            skin is crispy and the flesh is tender and flaky.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Occasionally baste the fish with any remaining marinade during grilling for extra flavor.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    Prepare the Garnishes:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            While the fish is grilling, slice tomatoes and onions, and chop fresh herbs like cilantro
                            and parsley.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    Serving:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Once the fish is cooked, carefully transfer it to a serving platter.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Garnish with sliced tomatoes, onions, and fresh herbs.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Serve the Maskoof fish hot, accompanied by flatbread and rice.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
