            <p style="margin-left: 1%;">Iraqi Biryani is a flavorful and aromatic rice dish, distinct from its Indian
                counterpart, characterized by its unique blend of spices and ingredients. </p>
            <p style="margin-left: 1%;">It typically includes basmati rice, tender pieces of chicken or lamb, and a mix
                of vegetables like potatoes, carrots, and peas. </p>
            <p style="margin-left: 1%;">The dish is seasoned with a rich array of spices such as turmeric,
                cardamom, and cinnamon, giving it a vibrant yellow color and complex taste.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 1%;">Dried fruits and nuts, like raisins and almonds, are often added for a hint of
                sweetness and crunch.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 1%;">It's a festive dish, commonly served at special occasions and gatherings.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 1%;">Each bite offers a delightful mix of textures and flavors, showcasing the
                richness of Iraqi cuisine. </p>

            <h3>Cooking steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Prepare the Rice:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Rinse the basmati rice thoroughly under cold water until the water runs clear.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Soak the rice in water for about 30 minutes, then drain.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Boil a large pot of water, add salt, and cook the rice until it’s about 70% cooked (still a
                            bit firm). Drain and set aside.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                    Cook the Meat:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            In a large pot, heat vegetable oil or ghee over medium heat.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Add finely chopped onions and sauté until golden brown.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Add minced garlic and ginger, cooking until fragrant.

                    </ul>
                </li>

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Stir in the spices: turmeric, cardamom, cinnamon, cumin, coriander, cloves, bay leaves,
                            black pepper, and salt.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Add yogurt and mix well, allowing the mixture to cook until the vegetables are tender and
                            the meat is cooked through.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            Add the cooked meat and vegetable mixture on top of the rice layer.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Sprinkle some chopped fresh herbs (cilantro and mint) and dried fruits (raisins) over the
                            meat mixture.
                        </li>

                            Add the remaining rice on top of the meat and vegetable layer.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                            Drizzle some melted ghee or oil over the top layer of rice.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Cover the pot tightly with a lid, and place it on low heat.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Cook for about 20-30 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together and the rice to finish

                        </li>
