            <h3>Cooking steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Prepare the Rice:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Rinse the rice thoroughly under cold water until the water runs clear.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            In a large pot, combine rice with water (use a 1:1.5 ratio of rice to water) and a pinch of
                            salt.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until the rice is fully cooked
                            and sticky.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    Form the Dough:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Allow the cooked rice to cool slightly, then transfer it to a food processor.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Process the rice until it forms a smooth, sticky dough. You may need to add a little water
                            if the mixture is too dry.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Let the dough rest for a bit to cool completely.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                <li>
                    Cook the Meat:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            In a large skillet, heat a bit of oil over medium heat.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Add finely chopped onions and saut√© until they become translucent.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Add the ground lamb or beef, breaking it up as it cooks.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Season with allspice, cumin, cinnamon, salt, and black pepper. Stir well to combine.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Cook until the meat is fully browned and the spices are well incorporated.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Optionally, add pine nuts and cook for another minute.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Remove from heat and let the filling cool.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    Shape the Kubba:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Take a small ball of rice dough and flatten it into a thin disc in your hand.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Place a spoonful of the meat filling in the center of the disc.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Carefully fold the dough over the filling and seal the edges, shaping it into a disc
                            or oval.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Repeat until all the dough and filling are used.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    Frying the Kubba:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            In a deep frying pan or pot, heat vegetable oil or ghee over medium-high heat.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Once the oil is hot, carefully add the kubba in batches, making sure not to
                            overcrowd the pan.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Fry until golden brown and crispy, turning occasionally to ensure even cooking.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.
                        </li>
